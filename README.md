## prerequisites
To use this library, you'll need to have the following packages installed:

 **`- TrackingFieldsMixin`** from [sitech-django-models](https://github.com/sitmena/sitech-django-models)  and it is a Python package that allow you to access the old values of the model fields.
 You can run the [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) command to install the latest version:
 ```bash
 pip install git+https://github.com/sitmena/sitech-django-models.git@v1.0
```

<br>

 **`- RequestMiddleware`** from [sitech-django-middlewares](https://github.com/sitmena/sitech-django-middlewares)  and it is a Python package that allow you to access the [Request](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/ref/request-response/#httprequest-objects) or [User](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/ref/request-response/#django.http.HttpRequest.user) Object Inside the Models, Forms, Signals, ... etc.

You can do the following to install `RequestMiddleware`:
1. Run the [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) command to install the latest version:
```bash
 pip install git+https://github.com/sitmena/sitech-django-middlewares.git@v1.0.1
```
 2. Add `sitech_middlewares.request.RequestMiddleware` to `MIDDLEWARE` in settings.py:
 
```bash
 MIDDLEWARE = (
    ...
    'sitech_middlewares.request.RequestMiddleware',
 )
```

## Installation

1. Run the [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) command to install the latest version:

 )
```
3. Run the migration command:

## Usage
A neat feature of this package is that it can automatically log operations such as when a model is created, updated and deleted. To make this work all you need to add  `AuditLogMixin`  to your model.

Here's an example:
```python
 from django.db import models
 from sitech_audit_log import AuditLogMixin

 class Profile(models.Model, AuditLogMixin):  
	phone = models.CharField(max_length=255, verbose_name='Phone')
	address = models.TextField(max_length=512,verbose_name='Address')
```	

<hr>

### # Specifying  Log Storages:
Sitech Django Audit Log with several log storages backends. With the exception of the 'DatabaseBackend' (which is the default).  If you have special log storage requirements, you can [write your own log storage backend](#-defining-a-custom-log-storage-backend).

<hr>	

### # Customizing the operations being logged
By default the package will log the  `created`,  `updated`,  `deleted`  operations. You can modify this behaviour by setting the  `log_operation`  property on your model.

```python
 from django.db import models
 from sitech_audit_log import AuditLogMixin

 class Profile(models.Model, AuditLogMixin):  
	log_operation = ['updated']
	phone = models.CharField(max_length=255, verbose_name='Phone')
	address = models.TextField(max_length=512,verbose_name='Address')
```	

<hr>

### # Ignoring changes to certain fields
If your model contains fields whose change don't need to trigger an activity being logged you can use `ignore_changed_fields`

```python
 from django.db import models
 from sitech_audit_log import AuditLogMixin

 class Profile(models.Model, AuditLogMixin):  
	ignore_changed_fields = ['phone']
	phone = models.CharField(max_length=255, verbose_name='Phone')
	address = models.TextField(max_length=512,verbose_name='Address')
```	

Changing `phone` will not trigger an audit being logged.

<hr>

### # Defining a custom log storage backend

Custom log storage backends should subclass `BaseLoggingBackend` that is located in the `sitech_audit_log.backends.base` module. A custom log storage  backend must implement the `save(self, audit_log)` method. This method receives an instance of `AuditLog` class.

Hereâ€™s an example:

```python
 from sitech_audit_log.backends.base import BaseLoggingBackend

 class TestBackend(BaseLoggingBackend):  
	ignore_changed_fields = ['phone']
	def save(self, audit_log):  
    	"""  
	 	Save the given audit_log. 
	 	""" 
	 	print(audit_log.operation, audit_log.values)
```
